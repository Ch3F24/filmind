Hungary offers a very simple tax rebate system for film and/or television projects with eligible development and production expenditure by the Hungarian Motion Picture Act.

Most of cinema and television or other distribution platform films, series, tv-movies, shorts, documentaries, animations, even music videos can benefit, with the exception of advertisements, sitcoms, reality shows, daily soaps and other non-fiction television programs, games.

The tax rebate is 30% of the eligible Hungarian spent, the rebate has no cap.

In case of non-Hungarian expenditure (which means spent on non-Hungarian tax-payer individuals or companies which qualify even if are not spent within Hungary) up to 25% of the total Hungarian expenditure qualifies too, so in total 125% of Hungarian spent qualifies for the 30% tax-rebate.

((e.g. based on 1 million € eligible Hungarian expenditure and another 250.000€ expenditure paid by/through the local Hungarian production company the tax rebate can be as high as 375.000€). )

Foreign cast and crew may also be considered as Hungarian eligible costs if certain legal and accounting conditions are met, this way both the Hungarian and the foreign eligible costs, therefore the tax rebate can be increased.
