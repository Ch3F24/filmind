As cash rebate, service production is under the same consideration as any other way of production. If you send us your script, we will check if it complies with legal and content requirements. Along with it we send you a draft budget and a location mood to you to have detailed feedback on your project.

With Filmind, the application procedure to the National Film Office is easygoing: 

- with our expertise, we advise and provide the budget on the best and safest way to exploit the cash rebate
- we provide all legal documents to be submitted
- if needed, we can also arrange Hungarian VAT and rebate pre-financing

The application has to be submitted with the National Film Office at least 30 days prior to the first day of principal photography. The resolution based on the application will already contain the maximum exploitable cash rebate amount and is issued 60-70 days following submission. Right after the audit reports with the claimed rebate amounts can be filed, the Film Office issues the tax certificate and the National Film Institute wires the cash rebate. With our background this procedure is smooth and takes less time than in most of the neighbouring countries.
